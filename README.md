# react-native-spokestack

React Native wrapper for the [Spokestack](https://github.com/pylon/spokestack-android) speech activity detection/automated speech recognition project.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-spokestack --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-spokestack`

### Manual installation

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java` (could also be called `MainActivity.java` or similar)

- Add `import com.pylon.RNSpokestack.RNSpokestackPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
- Add `new RNSpokestackPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
   ```
   include ':react-native-spokestack'
   project(':react-native-spokestack').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-spokestack/android')
   ```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```
     implementation project(':react-native-spokestack')
   ```
   
#### iOS

  - Drag the RNSpokestack.xcodeproj from the react-native-spokestack/ios folder to the Libraries group on Xcode in your poject.

### Android Support

#### `android/build.gradle`

Make sure the Google repo is listed first

```
buildcripts {
   ...
    repositories {
      google()
      ...
    }
}

allprojects{
      repositories {
        google()
       ...
    }
}
```

#### `android/app/build.gradle`

```

...
android {
...
packagingOptions {
exclude 'project.properties'
exclude 'META-INF/INDEX.LIST'
exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES'
}
}
...

```

##### `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

## Usage

### Javascript

```javascript
import Spokestack from "react-native-spokestack";

// There are three events that can be bound with callbacks

// initialize the Spokestack pipeline.
// The pipeline has three required top-level keys: 'input', 'stages', and 'properties'.
// For further examples, see https://github.com/pylon/spokestack-android#configuration
Spokestack.initialize({
  input: "com.pylon.spokestack.android.MicrophoneInput", // required, provides audio input into the stages
  stages: [
    "com.pylon.spokestack.libfvad.VADTrigger", // enable voice activity detection. necessary to trigger speech recognition.
    "com.pylon.spokestack.google.GoogleSpeechRecognizer" // one of the two supplied speech recognition services
    // 'com.pylon.spokestack.microsoft.BingSpeechRecognizer'
  ],
  properties: {
    locale: "en-US",
    "google-credentials": YOUR_GOOGLE_VOICE_CREDENTIALS
    // 'bing-speech-api-key': YOUR_BING_VOICE_CREDENTIALS
  }
});

// Binding events
const logEvent = e => console.log(e);
Spokestack.onSpeechStarted = logEvent;
Spokestack.onSpeechEnded = logEvent;
Spokestack.onSpeechError = e => {
  Spokestack.stop();
  logEvent(e);
};
Spokestack.onSpeechRecognized = e => {
  logEvent(e);
  console.log(e.transcript); // "Hello Spokestack"
};

Spokestack.start(); // start voice activity detection and speech recognition. can only start after initialize is called.
Spokestack.stop(); // stop voice activity detection and speech recognition. can only start after initialize is called
// NB start() and stop() can be called repeatedly.
```
